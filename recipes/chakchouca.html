    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka) is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes, onions, pepper, spices, and eggs. It's usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It is similar to the Turkish dish menemen and the Latin American breakfast dish huevos rancheros.</p>

    <p> Nextly, the ingredients and its quantities will be shown followed by the procedures: </p>
